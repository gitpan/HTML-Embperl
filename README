OVERVIEW

Look at perldoc Embperl for documentation.

Embperl allows you to embed perl code in your HTML documents. The code can 
be used to compute something (e.g. retrieve data from a database) or to 
produce output (e.g. display a variable). Also some metacommands are 
available which give you the ability to create "loops" or to conditional 
process your HTML document. As fours feature some HTML tags are specially
interpreted. This allows dynamic table creation and an easier form processing.

Embperl can run offline, as CGI script or as module using mod_perl of the 
Apache httpd (which is the fastest approach). A fours method is to let it 
run as a separate process, which is at the moment only for debugging 
issues.

INSTALATION

NOTE: Embperl has been renamed to HTML::Embperl in this version. Please remove
      old Embperl before you continue. Under the perl directory you have to
      remove the following files/directories:
      
      man/man3/Embperl.3
      site_perl/auto/Embperl
      site_perl/Embperl.pm
      site_perl/<processor>-<os>/auto/Embperl
       
- Unpack the archive
- perl Makefile.PL
You will be ask if want to compile in support for Apache mod_perl. If 
you say yes, the source of Apache is searched (for headerfiles). If 
it can't found, please specify the basepath. Please make sure 
mod_perl is already installed. If you have installed mod_perl-0.96 or
higher Makefile.PL automaticly suggest the same source path as used to
build mod_perl.

- make
- make test
- make install

See perldoc Embperl how it goes on.
See the eg/ directory for examples.

I have successfully tested this on Linux 2.0.27, mod_perl 0.96 with perl 
5.003 and Apache 1.2b7. Since there is (as far as I can see) no system 
dependent stuff, it should work on other systems as well.

FEEDBACK

Please give me a feedback if you use/test this module. Bugs, 
questions, thinks you would find useful etc. are discussed on the mod_perl
mailling list.
