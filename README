OVERVIEW


Embperl gives you the power to embed Perl code in your HTML documents.
Using Perl means being able to use a very elaborate programming language,
which is widely used for WWW purposes. You can also use hundreds of Perl
modules which have already been written - including DBI - for database
access to a growing number of database systems.

While this could also be done with other packages, Embperl has several
features especially for HTML: dynamic tables, formfield-processing,
escaping/unescaping and more.

Embperl is a server-side tool, which means it's browser-indpendent.
It can run in various ways: Under mod_perl, as a cgi script, or offline. 

There is also a module for Database access within Embperl, look
at DBIx::Recordset.
