OVERVIEW

Look at perldoc Embperl for documentation.
or at http://perl.apache.org/embperl.html for a short description

Embperl allows you to embed perl code in your HTML documents. The code can 
be used to compute something (e.g. retrieve data from a database) or to 
produce output (e.g. display a variable). Also some metacommands are 
available which give you the ability to create "loops" or to conditional 
process your HTML document. As fours feature some HTML tags are specially
interpreted. This allows dynamic table creation and an easier form processing.

Embperl can run offline, as CGI script or as module using mod_perl of the 
Apache httpd (which is the fastest approach).

PLEASE

I think it's time to make the first release version of Embperl.
As far as I can see I have fixed all known/reported errors and finished
all the outstanding stuff. So I hope HTML::Embperl-0.24-beta is ready
for turning it into a release version.

So PLEASE if you use/want to use Embperl download the 0.24 and test it, so
it can be made sure that it compiles/works without any problems.
PLEASE give me a feedback if it works or not for you, maybe you can
attach the platform you are using and what you are doing with Embperl.


INSTALATION

- Unpack the archive
- perl Makefile.PL
You will be ask if want to compile in support for Apache mod_perl. If 
you say yes, the source of Apache is searched (for headerfiles). If 
it can't found, please specify the basepath. Please make sure 
mod_perl is already installed. If you have installed mod_perl-0.96 or
higher Makefile.PL automaticly suggest the same source path as used to
build mod_perl.
NOTE: When you using Embperl-0.20 and higher mod_perl must be build with
      PERL_CLEANUP=1 and PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS=1 

- make
- make test
- make install

See perldoc Embperl how it goes on.
See the eg/ directory for examples.

I have successfully tested this on Linux 2.0.27, mod_perl 0.96 and higher,
with perl 5.003 and 5.004 and Apache 1.2. Since there is (as far as I can see)
no system dependent stuff, it should work on other systems as well.
As far as possible use perl 5.004_04, because 5.004 has memory leaks.
Also I suggest to use mod_perl-1.07_02 or higher because of a memory leak
in Apache->push_handler in mod_perl versions before 1.07_02

WIN 32

I have tested the offline mode on Windows 95 with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2
compiler. The other modes I didn't tested yet.
I have used the official port of perl 5.004_02, which can be found as
precompiled binaries (including a lot of modules) on CPAN in subdirectory

/authors/id/GSAR/perl5.00402-bindist04-bc.tar.gz


On Windows 95 you have todo the following:

perl Makefile.PL
nmake (you must have the c compiler in your path)

you will get an error about compiling Embperl.c. Edit Embperl.c and change

-#line  "Embperl.xs"

to

+#line  1 "Embperl.xs"

now rerun nmake and it should compile.
As last step you should do a "nmake test" and if it doesn't fail a 
"nmake install"


NOTE!

In version 0.16 and above you need to set the 'Options ExecCGI' in your
srm.conf for running under mod_perl!

FEEDBACK

Please give me a feedback if you use/test this module. Bugs, 
questions, thinks you would find useful etc. are discussed on the mod_perl
mailling list.
