OVERVIEW
========

Embperl gives you the power to embed Perl code in your HTML documents
and the ability to build your Web site out of small reusable objects in
an object-oriented style. You can also take advantage of all the
usual Perl modules, (including DBI for database access) use their
functionality and easily include their output in your web pages.

Embperl has several features which are especially useful for creating
HTML, including dynamic tables, form field processing, URL
escaping/unescaping, session handling, and more.

Embperl is a server-side tool, which means that it's browser-independent. 
It can run in various ways: under mod_perl, as a CGI script, or offline.

For database access, there is a module called DBIx::Recordset, which 
works well together with Embperl and simplifies creating web pages
with database content.

FEATURES
========

* Lets you embed Perl code into HTML documents. Perl code is
  evaluated at the server side and the result is sent to the browser.

* Offers various meta-commands for conditional and loop 
  processing of the HTML documents.

* Automatically generates dynamic HTML tables/lists from Perl arrays or
  function calls (e.g. DBI fetch)

* Form data send to your document is placed in a hash

* Automatically inserts data from the form hash into HTML input,
  textarea and select tags

* Understands HTML and URL escaping and unescaping

* Handles per-user and per-module persistent session data for you.
  All you need to do is store and retrieve them to and from
  a special hash.

* Allows you to build your web-site out of components. Frequently used 
  elements can be defined once and included in every page.

* EmbperlObject allows you to define the standard layout of your site just
  once and includes the neccessary components based on the uri. Your HTML
  documents just have to contain the unique stuff and not the common stuff
  like headers/footers or navigation bars. Also these common element can 
  be overwritten in each subdirectory.

* Gives you the possibility to build libraries with a set of frequently used 
  Elements or components, and make them available to the whole web-site in the
  same way as Perl modules are - well, modularized.

* Supports debugging of pages by generating a very detailed
  log file and making it accessible via the browser with a single click.

* Generates verbose error pages in which every error can link 
  to the log file. This is ideal for debugging.

* Offers a lot of options for maximum configurability according to your 
  personal tastes and needs.

* Fully integrated into Apache and mod_perl to acheive the best
  performance. Can also run as a CGI-script, offline or called from
  another Perl program.

* The Perl module DBIx::Recordset offers high level, easy to handle
  database access for Embperl.

* If you are concerned about security you can configure Embperl to use
  Safe.pm. This way, your documents can run in a safe namespace which
  can allow or disallow certain Perl opcodes.

* I<HTML::Embperl::Mail> gives you the possibility to send the result directly
  to a email address
