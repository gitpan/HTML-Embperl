<title>Some Plain tests for Embperl using optRawInput</title>
</head>

<body>

Here it starts with some HTML Text<P>

All values should be undefined:

$a = [+ $a || '' +] <BR>
$b = [+ $b || '' +] <BR>
$c = [+ $c || '' +] <BR>
$d = [+ $d || '' +] <BR>
$e = [+ $e || '' +] <BR>


First of all assign a value:
[- $a = '(this is the value in $a)' -] <BR>

Now we have some 'Umlaute':


[- $b = "$a 
 &auml;&ouml;&uuml;" -]

Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
[+ $a +] [+ $b +]<BR>

And now a and b together: [+ "$a$b" +]<P>

Here we have some HTML tags within the perl code, <br>
Embperl will not delete them when optRawInput is set !<BR>

[+ $c = "<BR> 6 + 17 <font size=\"3\"> * 3" +]

Here we have something which looks like a HTML tag, but does not start with<br>
a character, Embperl does not change them!<BR>

[+ "SELECT * FROM a ORDER BY b USING <; Hi There>" +]

Embperl will not translate HMTL escapes to the right characters <br>
when optRawInput is set<BR>

[- $e = 2 -]
[+ $d = "$e &lt; 6" +]

Now they should have a value

$a = [+ $a +] <BR>
$b = [+ $b +] <BR>
$c = [+ $c +] <BR>
$d = [+ $d +] <BR>
$e = [+ $e +] <BR>

<P>Ok.<P>


optRawInput is now: [+ $optRawInput +] <BR>
optRawInput is set now to: [+ $optRawInput = 1 +] <BR>
optRawInput is now: [+ $optRawInput +] <BR>

[+ $c = "<BR> 6 + 17 <font size=\"3\"> * 3" +]

[- $b = "$a 
 &auml;&ouml;&uuml;" -]

Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
$a = [+ $a +] <BR>
$b = [+ $b +] <BR>
$c = [+ $c +] <BR>

optRawInput is now: [+ $optRawInput +] <BR>
optRawInput is set now to: [+ $optRawInput = 0 +] <BR>
optRawInput is now: [+ $optRawInput +] <BR>

[+ $c = "<BR> 6 + 17 <font size=\"3\"> * 3" +]

[- $b = "$a 
 &auml;&ouml;&uuml;" -]

Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
$a = [+ $a +] <BR>
$b = [+ $b +] <BR>
$c = [+ $c +] <BR>
