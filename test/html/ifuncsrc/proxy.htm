This document contains SSI and Embperl commands<BR>


<!--#set var="abc" -->

<!--#printenv -->


Here it starts with some HTML Text<P>

All values should be undefined:

$a = [+ $a || '' +] <BR>
$b = [+ $b || '' +] <BR>
$c = [+ $c || '' +] <BR>
$d = [+ $d || '' +] <BR>
$e = [+ $e || '' +] <BR>


First of all assign a value:
[- $a = '(this is the value in $a)' -] <BR>

Now we have some 'Umlaute':


[- $b = "$a &auml;&ouml;&uuml;" -]

Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
[+ $a +] [+ $b +]<BR>

And now a and b together: [+ "$a$b" +]<P>

Here we have some HTML tags within the perl code, Embperl will delete them!<BR>

[+ $c = <BR> 6 + 17 <font size="3"> * 3 </font> &nbsp;&nbsp; + 0 +]
[+ "SELECT * <br> FROM a ORDER BY b USING <; Hi There>" +]

Here we have something which looks like a HTML tag, but does not start with<br>
a character, Embperl does not change them!<BR>

[+ "SELECT * FROM a ORDER BY b USING <; Hi There>" +]

Embperl will also translate HMTL escapes to the right characters i.e. $a &amp;lt; 6 will get the perl expression $a &lt; 6: <BR>

[- $e = 2 -]
[+ $d = $e &lt; 6 +]

Now they should have a value

$a = [+ $a +] <BR>
$b = [+ $b +] <BR>
$c = [+ $c +] <BR>
$d = [+ $d +] <BR>
$e = [+ $e +] <BR>

<P>Ok.<P>
