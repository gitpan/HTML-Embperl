[###### second sub #####]
[$sub perl_code $]
*perl_code* 
*perl_code* Here comes some perl:

*perl_code* [- $foo = 'Hello world' -]

<h1>Tests for Embperl - Embperl sub Metacommand</h1>

[- $testdata = 'abcd' -]

Now we call the first sub via Execute:

[- Execute ('#txt') -]

And now the second via Execute:

[- Execute ('#perl_code') -]

Now we call the first sub via Perl:

[- txt -]

And now the second via Perl:

[- perl_code -]

-> Second time, other order:

And now the second via Perl:

[- perl_code -]

Now we call the first sub via Perl:

[- txt -]

-> And Execute again, but other order

And now the second via Execute:

[- Execute ('#perl_code') -]

Now we call the first sub via Execute:

[- Execute ('#txt') -]



And done!
