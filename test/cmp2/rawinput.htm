<title>Some Plain tests for Embperl using optRawInput</title>
</head>

<body>

Here it starts with some HTML Text<P>

All values should be undefined:

$a =  <BR>
$b =  <BR>
$c =  <BR>
$d =  <BR>
$e =  <BR>


First of all assign a value:
<BR>

Now we have some 'Umlaute':


Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
(this is the value in $a) (this is the value in $a) 
 &amp;auml;&amp;ouml;&amp;uuml;<BR>

And now a and b together: (this is the value in $a)(this is the value in $a) 
 &amp;auml;&amp;ouml;&amp;uuml;<P>

Here we have some HTML tags within the perl code, <br>
Embperl will not delete them when optRawInput is set !<BR>

&lt;BR&gt; 6 + 17 &lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; * 3
Here we have something which looks like a HTML tag, but does not start with<br>
a character, Embperl does not change them!<BR>

SELECT * FROM a ORDER BY b USING &lt;; Hi There&gt;
Embperl will not translate HMTL escapes to the right characters <br>
when optRawInput is set<BR>

2 &amp;lt; 6
Now they should have a value

$a = (this is the value in $a) <BR>
$b = (this is the value in $a) 
 &amp;auml;&amp;ouml;&amp;uuml; <BR>
$c = &lt;BR&gt; 6 + 17 &lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; * 3 <BR>
$d = 2 &amp;lt; 6 <BR>
$e = 2 <BR>

<P>Ok.<P>


optRawInput is now: 1 <BR>
optRawInput is set now to: 1 <BR>
optRawInput is now: 1 <BR>

&lt;BR&gt; 6 + 17 &lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; * 3
Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
$a = (this is the value in $a) <BR>
$b = (this is the value in $a) 
 &amp;auml;&amp;ouml;&amp;uuml; <BR>
$c = &lt;BR&gt; 6 + 17 &lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; * 3 <BR>

optRawInput is now: 1 <BR>
optRawInput is set now to: 0 <BR>
optRawInput is now: 0 <BR>

&lt;BR&gt; 6 + 17 &lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; * 3
Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
$a = (this is the value in $a) <BR>
$b = (this is the value in $a) 
 &amp;auml;&amp;ouml;&amp;uuml; <BR>
$c = &lt;BR&gt; 6 + 17 &lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt; * 3 <BR>
