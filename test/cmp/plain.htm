<title>Some Plain tests for Embperl</title>
</head>

<body>

Here it starts with some HTML Text<p>

First of all assign a value:
 <br>

Now we have some 'Umlaute':




Now lets look what we are getting from this:<br>
(this is the value in $a) (this is the value in $a) &auml;&ouml;&uuml;<br>

And now a and b together: (this is the value in $a)(this is the value in $a) &auml;&ouml;&uuml;<p>

Here we have some HTML tags within the perl code, Embperl will delete them!<br>

Embperl will also translate HMTL escapes to the right characters i.e. $a &amp;lt; 6 will get the perl expression $a &lt; 6: <br>

<p>Ok.<p>
