<title>Some Plain tests for Embperl</title>
</head>

<body>

Here it starts with some HTML Text<P>

All values should be undefined:

$a =  <BR>
$b =  <BR>
$c =  <BR>
$d =  <BR>
$e =  <BR>

Here we will see an error:

First of all assign a value:
<BR>

Now we have some 'Umlaute':


Second Error:<BR>
 <BR>

And now a and b together: (this is the value in $a)(this is the value in $a) &auml;&ouml;&uuml;<P>

Here we have some HTML tags within the perl code, Embperl will delete them!<BR>

Embperl will also translate HMTL escapes to the right characters i.e. $a &amp;lt; 6 will get the perl expression $a &lt; 6: <BR>

Now they should have a value
Tag missmatch:

<table>
