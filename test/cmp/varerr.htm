<title>Some Plain tests for Embperl</title>
</head>

<body>



Here it starts with some HTML Text<P>


All values should be undefined:

$vara =  <BR>
$varb =  <BR>
$c =  <BR>
$d =  <BR>
$e =  <BR>


First of all assign a value:
 <BR>

Now we have some 'Umlaute':




Now lets look what we are getting from this:<BR>
(this is the value in $vara) (this is the value in $vara) &auml;&ouml;&uuml;<BR>

And now a and b together: (this is the value in $vara)(this is the value in $vara) &auml;&ouml;&uuml;<P>

Here we have some HTML tags within the perl code, Embperl will delete them!<BR>

57

Embperl will also translate HMTL escapes to the right characters i.e. $vara &amp;lt; 6 will get the perl expression $vara &lt; 6: <BR>


1

Now they should have a value

$vara = (this is the value in $vara) <BR>
$varb = (this is the value in $vara) &auml;&ouml;&uuml; <BR>
$c = 57 <BR>
$d = 1 <BR>
$e = 2 <BR>

<P>Ok.<P>
