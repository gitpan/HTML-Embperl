<title>Some Plain tests for Embperl</title>
</head>

<body>

Here it starts with some HTML Text<P>

All values should be undefined:

$a = [+ $a +] <BR>
$b = [+ $b +] <BR>
$c = [+ $c +] <BR>
$d = [+ $d +] <BR>
$e = [+ $e +] <BR>

Here we will see an error:

[- $a = (qqqqqqqqqqqqqq -]

First of all assign a value:
[- $a = '(this is the value in $a)' -] <BR>

Now we have some 'Umlaute':


[- $b = "$a &auml;&ouml;&uuml;" -]

Second Error:<BR>
[+ $a+ +] [+ qq2$b +]<BR>

And now a and b together: [+ "$a$b" +]<P>

Here we have some HTML tags within the perl code, Embperl will delete them!<BR>

[+ $c = <BR> 6 + 17 <font size="3"> * 3 +]

Embperl will also translate HMTL escapes to the right characters i.e. $a &amp;lt; 6 will get the perl expression $a &lt; 6: <BR>

[- $e = 2 -]
[+ $d = $e &lt; 6 +]

Now they should have a value
[$if {$error is here ) $]
$a = [+ $a +] <BR>
$b = [+ $b +] <BR>
$c = [+ $c +] <BR>
$d = [+ $d +] <BR>
$e = [+ $e +] <BR>
[$endif$]



<P>Ok.<P>
