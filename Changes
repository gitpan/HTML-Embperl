Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Embperl.

0.16-beta  29 Aug 97
   - Added more restrictive access check when running under mod_perl 
     * Option ExecCGI must be set
     * must not a directory
   - Added a little bit more docs about how to view Embperl lofile with
     your browser
   - Added declaration for error dependend stuff to compile on solaris, check errno before
     accessing sys_errlist to avoid SIGSEVs, Fixed another warning from Sun Pro C Compiler
     (Thanks to Dan Peterson)
   - Switched I/O to PerlIO if supported by installed Perl version.
     Should now work with sfio (not tested yet)
   - Added possibilty to include Embperl commands in all html tags 
     (did not works for body, table and tr tags in previous versions)
   - Preserve case of HTML tags
   - Do not interpret unknown html tags anyhow, to handle "<" characters
     which do not start a html tag better 
   - Do not display the time needed for the request if CLOCKS_PER_SEC not
     defined (e.g. SunOS - Thanks to Dan Peterson)
   - Added apache_xx/src/regx to include path, to avoid problems when
     apache was build with it's own regx library
   - Show which tags mismatch in error message (table, dir, select etc.)
   
   - Fixed a bug which caused "[" character even printed when in a false
     if path

        - Checked return code of Logfile open, to prevent a SIGSEV when cannot
          write to logfile and write an errormessage in servers errorlog  (Thanks to Dan Peterson)
        - Errors will also be logged to the servers error log (written to stderr)
          

0.14-beta 30 Juni 1997  
        - adding 8192 to EMBPERL_DEBUG and setting EMBPERL_VIRTLOG will add a link

        - added the LOG filehandle to print to the embperl logfile

          [- -] and [+ +] substituions takes place

        - Add #undefs for stdio function to compile with perl > 5.003
          Note: This is a quick hack, and will be changed to use PerlIO in
          one of the next releases, so we can tie stdout of Embperl
        - Add pids (to distinguish between muliplite requests) and time to
          logfile output
        - Make many functions static and names of externals more unique to
