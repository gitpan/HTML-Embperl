Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Embperl.

0.13-beta   April 26 1997	
        - Move EPENTRY (embperl_init) down to avoid crash when compiled with
          -DEPDEBUGALL
        - Add #undefs for stdio function to compile with perl > 5.003
          Note: This is a quick hack, and will be changed to use PerlIO in
          one of the next releases, so we can tie stdout of Embperl
        - Add pids (to distinguish between muliplite requests) and time to
          logfile output
        - Make many functions static and names of externals more unique to
          avoid conflicts of symbolnames with other modules
        - If file not found return status 404 instead of 500
	- Add Apache::Embperl so the module shows at CPAN also under 
	  module/by-module/Apache/ as suggested by Doug MacEachern
