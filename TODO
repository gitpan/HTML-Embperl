TODO for Embperl

Here some of my plans

- Tainting does work correct with perl 5.004
- Kill lf in middel of perl strings
- Debug namespaces and operation restriction
- Runtime configuration
- Add a DBI databaseinterface
- Speed optimizations
- Precompile the embedded HTML document to make it run faster
