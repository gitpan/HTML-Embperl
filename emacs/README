Betreff: RE: Embperl mode for Emacs?

I've attached the embperl.el file to this e-mail.  It's ready for use,
even if it's not the most beautiful piece of Emacs Lisp code in the
world.  It also isn't heavily tested -- it's not going to destroy
anybody's files or anything, but it may have trouble doing some mode
switching.

In order to use it, one must stick the following in his .emacs file:

(autoload 'embperl-minor-mode "embperl" "HTML::Embperl Mode" t)

They also need to stick embperl.el somewhere in their load-path.

I'm more than willing to take suggestions and help for this; please feel 
free to stick my name and e-mail address in a README file somewhere.
The homepage for this bit of code is
<URL:http://mother.mind.net/~erik/>.

I'll also make sure to keep you updated if anything changes.

Thank you very much for including this!  I think it'll make a lot of
Embperl coders very happy.  :)
