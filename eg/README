This directory contains a few examples for use of Embperl.

eg/x		Here are the following html files
eg/images	Here are the background  GIF

while.htm	simple html file which show how you can use the while 
                matacommand to display an array/hash (here %ENV)

table.htm	simple html file which shows how to use the dynamic table 
                feature (also displays %ENV)

neu.htm	        this example shows many of the feature of Embperl, as 
                embedding various code, conditional processing and form 
		management (It's in German but I think it can be understand 
		anyway). If called it works like a wizard known from windows 
		95 where you can enter data on some consecutive pages and walk 
		forward or back at everytime preserving the input made so far. 
		Note that the database interface is missing from this example, 
		since it isn't ready. 
NOTE: To make it work correctly you have to change the action 
to what ever is appropriate for your environment. If you 
running mod_perl you don't have to do anything at all, if you 
use a CGI script as handler or action it should also work. All 
other should add the path to your cgi-bin directory (e.g. 
/cgi-bin/Embperl/path/to/eg/x/neu.htm)
