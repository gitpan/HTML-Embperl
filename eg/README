This directory contains a few examples for use of Embperl.

eg/x		Here are the following html files
eg/images	Here are the background  GIF

while.htm	simple html file which show how you can use the while 
                matacommand to display an array/hash (here %ENV)

table.htm	simple html file which shows how to use the dynamic table 
                feature (also displays %ENV)

lists.htm       shows you how to use dynamic lists and listboxes and
                dropdownboxes

config.htm      print out your perl config, like perl -V does

neu.htm	        this example shows many of the feature of Embperl, as 
                embedding various code, conditional processing and form 
		management (It's in German but I think it can be understand 
		anyway). If called it works like a wizard known from windows 
		95 where you can enter data on some consecutive pages and walk 
		forward or back at everytime preserving the input made so far. 
		Note that the database interface is missing from this example, 
		since it isn't ready. 

Execute.pl      This is an perl script which shows how to use the function
                HTML::Embperl::Execute. It runs under Apache::Registry, look
                at the comment on the top when you want to run it offline.

You can also look at the directory test/html. The files found here are
will transformed to the files found in test/cmp, the request for that can
be found at the beginning of test.pl.
NOTE: Files in test/html are tests, some things don't make sense for real usage
