=head1 INSTALLATION


=head2 UNIX

- B<Unpack the archive>

- B<perl Makefile.PL>

You will be asked if you want to compile in support for Apache mod_perl. If
you say yes, the source of Apache is searched (for headerfiles). If 
it can't found, please specify the basepath. Please make sure 
mod_perl is already installed. If you have installed mod_perl-0.96 or
higher, Makefile.PL automatically suggests the same source path as was 
used to build mod_perl.

- B<make>

- B<make test>

- B<make install>

B<NOTE 1:> (only Embperl-1.2b1 or higher) For using session handling you need
Apache::Session-1.00 or higher. If possible use Apache::Session 1.52 or higher.
Starting with Embperl 1.3b7 Apache::Session 0.17 is B<NOT> supported anymore.

B<NOTE 2:> I<Embperl> runs without additional Perl modules, but the C<make test>
needs the following modules to work:

=over 4

=item * URI

=item * MIME::Base64 

=item * HTML::Parser 

=item * HTML::HeadParser 

=item * Digest::MD5 

=item * libnet 

=item * libwww 

=item * libwin32 (only Win32) 

=back

B<NOTE 3:> I<EmbperlObject> needs the following modules to work:

=over 4

=item * File::Spec 0.82 or higher

=back

If you have already successfully build and tested C<mod_perl> all modules
will already be there.

=head2 Options for make test

C<make test> can take several options, with can be given with the C<TESTARGS>
parameter:

  make test TESTARGS="--help"

will show you a list of available option. Most of them you will never need,
they are mainly nesseccary for debugging I<Embperl> itself.


=head2 Debian packages

The Debian packages are maintained by Angus Lees. Here are his
installation hints:

i've also setup an apt repository for those using stable (potato). to
use it, just add these lines to /etc/apt/sources.list (deb-src line is
only necessary if you want to download the source at some point):

  deb http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~gusl/embperl stable/binary-$(ARCH)/
  deb-src http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~gusl/embperl stable/source/

then run "apt-get update" followed by either
"apt-get install libhtml-embperl-perl" or just "apt-get upgrade" if
you already have embperl installed.

if you don't like apt, and want to do it the old fashioned way, i'm
sure you can work out how to download the .deb manually.


notes:

currently i only have i386 packages built for stable. if anyone wants
to build other archs and let me know, i can add them in (else, i can
probably get a sparc and alpha version compiled)


the package for unstable is compiled against perl5.6, so it has to
conflict with earlier mod_perl packages that are compiled against
perl5.5. unfortunately, there is no perl5.6 apache-perl package yet
(drow assures me he's uploading one soon), so you have to make do with
a DSO mod-perl (ie: apache + libapache-mod-perl) for now.


=head2 WIN 32

I have tested the offline mode on Windows 95 with a Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2
compiler and I have succesfully run Embperl with apache_1.3b5-1.3.9 / 
mod_perl-1.12-1.21 / perl5.004_04-perl5.005 (without threads) on Windows NT
with VC++ 5.0. 

B<NOTE:> It was necessary for me to compile perl5.004_04 with the VC++ on my own
to get it to run with Apache and mod_perl, while I was able to use the binary
distribution (/authors/id/GSAR/perl5.00402-bindist04-bc.tar.gz) of Perl for
offline testing under Win 95.

B<NOTE:> You need mod_perl >= 1.12 on win32


On Windows 95/NT you have to do the following:

B<perl Makefile.PL>

B<nmake> (you must have the c compiler in your path)

if you get an error about compiling Embperl.c. Edit Embperl.c and change

-#line  "Embperl.xs"

to

+#line  1 "Embperl.xs"

now re-run nmake and it should compile.

B<nmake test>

B<NOTE:> nmake test needs libwin32, libwww and HTML::Parser installed to work

B<nmake install>

B<NOTE 1:> (only Embperl-1.2b1 or higher) For using session handling you need
Apache::Session-1.00 or higher. If possible use Apache::Session 1.52 or higher.
Starting with Embperl 1.3b7 Apache::Session 0.17 is B<NOT> supported anymore.

B<NOTE 2:> I<Embperl> runs without additional Perl modules, but the C<make test>
needs the following modules to work:

=over 4

=item * URI

=item * MIME::Base64 

=item * HTML::Parser 

=item * HTML::HeadParser 

=item * Digest::MD5 

=item * libnet 

=item * libwww 

=item * libwin32 (only Win32) 

=back

B<NOTE 3:> I<EmbperlObject> needs the following modules to work:

=over 4

=item * File::Spec 0.82 or higher

=back

If you have already successfully build and tested C<mod_perl> all modules
will already be there.
